#### Background/Overview:

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is dedicated to providing scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystem and environmental health, and the effects of climate and land-use changes. Their scientists innovate new methods and tools to deliver timely, relevant, and useful information about Earth's processes.

USGS aims to develop new tools for visualizing their earthquake data. Despite collecting vast amounts of data globally each day, they currently lack an effective way to display it. This project seeks to create a visualization system for USGS data, enhancing public education and informing other government organizations about planetary issues, potentially securing more funding in the process.
